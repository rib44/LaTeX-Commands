Introduction
Simple text formatting helps to highlight important concepts within a document and make it more readable. Using italics, bold or underlined words can change the perception of the reader.

In this article three basic text formatting tools will be explained: italics, bold and underline. Let's begin with an example:

Some of the \textbf{greatest} 
discoveries in \underline{science} 
were made by \textbf{\textit{accident}}.

As you can see, there are three basic commands and they can be nested to get combined effects.

Note: The original text-formatting commands from plain TeX, \it (italicize) and \bf (bold face) will still work in a LaTeX document but their use is discouraged and not recommended because they don't preserve previous styles. For example, when using those old commands you can't apply both italics and bold at the same time.

Italicized text
To make a text italic is straightforward, use the \emph or \textit command:

Some of the greatest 
discoveries in science 
were made by \emph{accident}.

Bold text
To make a text bold use \textbf command:

Some of the \textbf{greatest} 
discoveries in science 
were made by accident.

Underlined text
To underline text use the \underline command:

Some of the greatest 
discoveries in \underline{science} 
were made by accident.

Emphasising text
Text can be emphasized using the \emph command. Sometimes the \emph command behaves just as \textit, but is not exactly the same:

Some of the greatest \emph{discoveries} 
in science 
were made by accident.

\textit{Some of the greatest \emph{discoveries} 
in science 
were made by accident.}

\textbf{Some of the greatest \emph{discoveries} 
in science 
were made by accident.}
